The words push-forward and pull-back get thrown around alot in category theory. In my opinion they describe a nice ideas, that occure often in mathematics. 

The concept applies to a familiar and very general situation in mathematics. 

Given two objects X, Y in a category and a morphism between them (say two vector spaces),

\begin{tikzcd}
X \arrow[rr, "f"] &  & Y
\end{tikzcd}

now say we have a property/construction on X. This can be anything, for example a measure (X measure space), the jacobian at a point (X smooth manifold), the set of singular simplices. Given this data we can define the push-forward, by post-composing via the morphism f, this yields for example the push-forward measure, the push-forward differential, or a singular simplex in Y.
