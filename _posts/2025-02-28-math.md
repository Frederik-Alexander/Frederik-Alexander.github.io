The words push-forward and pull-back get thrown around alot in category theory. In my opinion they describe a nice ideas, that occure often in mathematics. 

The concept applies to a familiar and very general situation in mathematics. 

Given two objects X, Y in a category and a morphism between them (say two vector spaces),

\begin{tikzcd}
X \arrow[rr, "f"] &  & Y
\end{tikzcd}

now say we have a property/construction on X. This can be anything , the jacobian at a point (X smooth manifold), the set of singular simplices. Given this data we can define the push-forward, by post-composing via the morphism f, this yields for example the push-forward measure, the push-forward differential, or a singular simplex in Y. So we push-forward property to Y.

Sometimes nomaclature obsureces this principle a bit, 

let us consider the pushforward measure,

We first need to pas to the inverse image map, via the contravariant power set functor, then, applying the meaure via postcompositin is indeede just the push-forward idea. 



Now for the pullback, we have a similar idea. 

For example given a map out of Y, say y* : Y \to R, if Y is a Vector space and R are the reals. We can define the pull-back, by precomistion with f.

\begin{tikzcd}
X \arrow[rr, "f"] \arrow[rrdd, "x*", dashed] &  & Y \arrow[dd, "y*"] \\
                                             &  &                    \\
                                             &  & \mathbb{R}        
\end{tikzcd}

This defines us a new map x*: X \to R, x* = y* \comp f.
