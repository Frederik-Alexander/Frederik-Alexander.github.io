Hello! My name is Frederik, and I am interested in applying ideas from pure mathematics to the field of deep learning. I am a master's student at the Technical University of Munich. Appart from that my learning style is more intuitive, and so, I would like to share some of my visual explanations on this website.

You can contact me anytime under +49 176 216 29 555 or frederik.t.alexander (at) gmail.com.
